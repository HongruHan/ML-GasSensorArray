# Machine Learning Project for Gas Sensor Array

This project classifies 12 different gas mixtures and predicts the concentration for each gas class. 

## Data set
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Gas sensor array under flow modulation Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+under+flow+modulation)

Description: There are 16 gas sensors recoding gas data in a continuous 5 minutes at 25Hz. And the same process was repeated 58 times. There are 16 features: each sensor stands for one feature, and each feature has "5 * 60 * 25 = 7500" readings. There are total 58 samples. 

## Enviroment requirement
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
